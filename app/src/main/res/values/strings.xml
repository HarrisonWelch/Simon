    <string name="howToPlayMainTextOriginal">
        Upon starting a game, Simon will start a pattern by lighting up one of the four colored buttons
        and playing a sound unique to that button. Your goal is to match that pattern that Simon plays,
        with each correct sequence adding another button to the end of the sequence.
        \n\nExample: If Simon lights up the blue button, you press the blue button. Then Simon lights up
        blue button and the red button, so you press the blue button and the red button in that order, continuing
        on until you make a mistake in the sequence.
        \n\nYour score at the end is however many buttons were in the last sequence successfully completed.
